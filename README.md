#SQL Challenge

This repository was created for DU Data Analytics Bootcamp homework after an introduction to creating databases in tables.

In this challenge I use pgAdmin4 to create several tables with correct data types, primary and foreign keys. Data is loaded into these tables from CSVs. I was then able to query, sort and join these tables to come to several differenct conclusions. These schemata and queries are the SQL files saved in this repo. 

I then took this data and loaded it into a Jupyter Notebook using SQLAlchemy. After it was imported, I used Pandas to create a histogram visualizing the most common salary ranges and a bar chart that illustrates average salary by title.
